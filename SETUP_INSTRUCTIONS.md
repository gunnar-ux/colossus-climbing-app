# 🚀 Colossus Setup Instructions

Your authentication and onboarding flow has been fixed! Here's what you need to do to get everything working:

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Set Up Environment Variables

**This is the most important step!** Your app needs these environment variables to connect to Supabase.

### 1. Create `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in your project root (`/Users/gunnarautterson/Desktop/Colossus/.env`) with your actual Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Get these values from https://supabase.com/dashboard
# Go to your project → Settings → API
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.your-anon-key-here
```

**Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase project URL and anon key.**

### 2. Configure Email Verification in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Set the **Site URL** to your development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)
3. Add your development URL to **Redirect URLs** (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/**`)

This fixes the "localhost is unreachable" email verification issue.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Authentication Flow Issues ✅
- **Fixed email verification redirect** - now points to your app's origin
- **Fixed "not authenticated" error** - app now handles email confirmation properly
- **Improved onboarding flow** - users can complete signup even before email confirmation

### New Onboarding Process ✅
1. **Account Creation** → User creates account, gets confirmation email
2. **Personal Info** → User enters name, age, gender, location  
3. **Physical Stats** → User enters height, weight, ape index
   - If not authenticated yet: stores data locally, creates profile when email confirmed
   - If authenticated: creates profile immediately
4. **Welcome Tour** → Introduction to the app
5. **Dashboard** → User can start using the app

### Code Cleanup ✅
- **Removed all debugging code** and console.logs
- **Removed test signin form** from main app
- **Clean, production-ready codebase**

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Start your dev server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Create a new account** with a real email address
3. **Complete the onboarding flow** (personal info + physical stats)
4. **Check your email** and click the confirmation link
5. **Your profile should be created automatically** when you return to the app

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Before Email Confirmation:
- User can complete entire onboarding flow
- Profile data is stored locally
- User sees welcome tour and can use app

### After Email Confirmation:
- User profile is created in Supabase database
- All locally stored data is synced
- Full app functionality is available

## 🐛 If You Still Have Issues

### "Invalid API key" error:
- Check your `.env` file exists and has correct values
- Restart your dev server after creating `.env`
- Verify you're using the **anon key**, not the service role key

### "Not authenticated" error:
- This should be fixed now, but if it persists:
- Clear your browser's localStorage
- Clear any browser cookies for your site
- Try the signup flow again

### Email confirmation issues:
- Check your Supabase Authentication settings
- Make sure Site URL and Redirect URLs are set correctly
- Check spam folder for confirmation emails

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your app now has a robust authentication system that:
- ✅ Handles email verification properly
- ✅ Provides smooth onboarding experience  
- ✅ Works both before and after email confirmation
- ✅ Automatically syncs data when user verifies email
- ✅ Is production-ready with clean code

The final step to your MVP is complete! 🚀
