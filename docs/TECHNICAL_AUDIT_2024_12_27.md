### Navigation Structure

The app uses a single-page architecture with client-side routing:

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - AuthPage → PersonalInfo → PhysicalStats → Dashboard

2. **Main App Navigation:**
   - Dashboard (home)
   - Sessions (list view)
   - Progress (achievements & trends)
   - Account (settings)
   - Track Climb (modal/overlay)

### State Management

- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state
- **Local State**: Component-level useState for UI state
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage (testing) / Supabase (production)
- **Session Management**: Real-time session tracking with "Now" session concept

### Data Flow

1. User logs climb → TrackClimb component
2. Data validated → Added to current/new session
3. Session updated → Metrics recalculated
4. Dashboard refreshed → New recommendations generated
5. Progress tracked → Achievements checked

## PART 2: DATA MODEL & STORAGE

## PART 4: CORE CALCULATIONS & FORMULAS

### 4.1 Climb Readiness Score (CRS)

**Formula Components (when calibrated):**
```javascript
CRS = (loadRecovery × 0.35) + (loadTrend × 0.25) + 
      (rpeRecovery × 0.20) + (volumePattern × 0.20)
```

**Scale:** 0-100
**Inputs:**
- Hours since last session
- Recent 7-day load
- Baseline 28-day load
- Last session RPE
- Volume consistency

**Calculation Location:** `/src/utils/metrics.js` - `calculateCRS()`
**Display Locations:** Dashboard (Today card), Main metrics

**Zones:**
- 77-100: Green (ready for high intensity)
- 45-76: Yellow (moderate training)
- 0-44: Red (recovery needed)

### 4.2 Load Ratio (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio)

**Windows:**
- Acute: 7 days
- Chronic: 28 days

**Load Calculation:**
```javascript
sessionLoad = Σ(gradePoints × rpe × styleMultiplier × attemptFactor)
where:
- gradePoints = V-grade + 1 (V0=1, V1=2, etc)
- styleMultiplier = Power:1.2, Technical:1.0, Simple:0.8
- attemptFactor = 1 + ((attempts - 1) × 0.1)
```

**Formula:** `ratio = acuteLoad / (chronicLoad/28 × 7)`

**Location:** `/src/utils/metrics.js` - `calculateLoadRatio()`
**Display:** Dashboard (if 5+ sessions)

**Thresholds:**
- <0.8: Low (undertraining)
- 0.8-1.3: Optimal (green)
- 1.3-1.5: Elevated (caution)
- >1.5: High (risk)

### 4.3 Session Statistics

All calculations in `/src/App.jsx` - `calculateSessionDistributions()`:

- **Total Climbs:** Simple count
- **Duration:** Last climb - first climb + 15min padding
- **Average RPE:** Mean of all climbs, rounded to 0.5
- **Median Grade:** Not actually calculated (uses mode)
- **Distributions:** Percentage of climbs by category

### 4.4 Weekly Statistics

Calculated from sessions within 7-day window:
- Volume: Sum of climbs
- Flash rate: Attempts = 1 count / total
- Grade progression: Comparison to previous week

### 4.5 All-Time Performance Metrics

- **Max Grade:** Highest V-grade attempted
- **Flash metrics:** Climbs with attempts = 1
- **Volume averages:** Total climbs / weeks since start
- **Style preferences:** Distribution percentages

### 4.6 XP System

**Formula:**
```javascript
climbXP = baseXP(10) × gradeMultiplier × flashBonus
where:
- gradeMultiplier = V-grade + 1
- flashBonus = 1.2 if attempts = 1, else 1.0
```

**Level Calculation:** `level = floor(totalXP / 150) + 1`
**Display:** Progress page, Account page

### 4.7 Achievements System

**Milestones:**
- Boulders: 50, 100, 250
- Flashes: 10, 25, 100
- Sessions: 5, 25, 50

**Unlock Logic:** Simple threshold checks against totals

### 6.3 Data Dependencies

**Dependency Chain:**
```
Sessions → Session Load → Load Ratio
         → RPE Average → CRS Calculation
         → Volume → Recommendations
Climbs → Distributions → Display Charts
       → XP → Level → Achievements
```

## PART 7: TESTING CHECKLIST

### 7.1 Calibration State Transitions

- [ ] Log 1 session → Verify "NEED DATA" state
- [ ] Log 2nd session → Still "NEED DATA"
- [ ] Log 3rd session → Verify transition to "CALIBRATING"
- [ ] Check Readiness becomes available
- [ ] Log 5th session → Verify "CALIBRATED" state
- [ ] Check Load Ratio becomes available

### 7.2 Edge Cases to Test

- [ ] Delete a session - does calibration state update? (No delete function implemented)
- [ ] Log session with 0 climbs (Not possible - climb required to create session)
- [ ] Log session spanning midnight (Handled correctly with timestamps)
- [ ] Very long session (>4 hours) (Duration calculation handles correctly)
- [ ] Flash-only session (Works correctly)
- [ ] Single climb session (Works correctly)

### 7.3 Formula Validation

- [ ] Manual calculation verification for Load Ratio ✓
- [ ] Readiness score boundary testing ✓
- [ ] Weekly stats on week boundaries ✓
- [ ] Monthly rollover handling (Not implemented - uses rolling windows)

## PART 8: LAUNCH READINESS ASSESSMENT

### 8.1 Critical Issues (Must Fix)

1. **Authentication System** - Currently using localStorage only. Supabase auth not connected.
2. **Data Persistence** - No cloud backup. Data loss risk on app deletion.
3. **Error Handling** - Limited error messages for failed operations.

### 8.2 Important Issues (Should Fix)

1. **Session Editing** - No way to edit/delete climbs or sessions
2. **Offline Support** - Service worker registered but offline functionality not implemented
3. **Loading States** - Some async operations lack loading indicators
4. **Input Validation** - Grade input allows any V-number (should cap at V17)

### 8.3 Nice-to-Have Improvements

1. **Export Data** - Allow users to export their climbing data
2. **Social Features** - Share sessions or achievements
3. **Custom Grades** - Support for gym-specific grading
4. **Photos** - Attach photos to climbs/sessions
5. **Goals** - Set and track climbing goals

### 8.4 Supabase Production Checklist

- [ ] Enable Auth with proper email verification
- [ ] Configure RLS policies (already in schema)
- [ ] Set up proper API keys and environment variables
- [ ] Add error retry logic for network failures
- [ ] Implement data sync conflict resolution
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure email templates

## PART 9: METRIC DEFINITIONS GLOSSARY

- **Load**: Weighted sum of climb difficulty considering grade, RPE, style, and attempts
- **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)**: 1-10 scale of effort, averaged per session
- **Flash**: Successful climb on first attempt (attempts = 1)
- **Style**: Primary climbing style - Power (dynamic), Technical (precise), Simple (basic)
- **Angle**: Wall angle - Slab (<90°), Vertical (90°), Overhang (>90°)
- **Session**: Continuous climbing period, auto-split after 90min gap
- **CRS**: Composite score (0-100) indicating readiness for hard climbing
- **Load Ratio**: Acute (7-day) vs Chronic (28-day) workload comparison
- **XP**: Experience points earned per climb based on grade and flash status
- **Level**: User progression tier based on total XP (150 XP per level)

## PART 10: CODEBASE RECOMMENDATIONS

### 10.1 Code Quality

**Issues to Address:**
1. **Duplicate Session Calculation** - Session duration calculated in multiple places
2. **Magic Numbers** - Hardcoded values (90min gap, 150 XP/level) should be constants
3. **Type Safety** - No TypeScript; consider adding for production
4. **Component Size** - Some components (App.jsx: 462 lines) should be split

**Well-Done Aspects:**
- Clear component organization
- Good separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Thoughtful comments

### 10.2 Data Model Improvements

**Recommended Additions:**
1. **Soft Deletes** - Add `deleted_at` field for sessions/climbs
2. **Gym Location** - Expand location tracking per session
3. **Notes Field** - Allow notes on climbs/sessions
4. **Weather/Conditions** - Track climbing conditions
5. **Project Tracking** - Mark climbs as projects vs sends

### 10.3 Technical Debt

**Priority Items:**
1. Connect Supabase authentication properly
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add comprehensive error logging
4. Create data migration utilities
5. Add unit tests for calculations
6. Implement proper TypeScript types

**Clean-up Needed:**
- Remove console.log statements
- Delete commented code blocks
- Consolidate duplicate utilities
- Standardize date handling

## Conclusion

### Ready for Launch: YES (with caveats)

The Pogo app is well-built and ready for invite-only testing. The core functionality is solid, calculations are accurate, and the UX is polished. However, production deployment requires connecting real authentication and data persistence.

### Critical Path Items:
1. **Connect Supabase Auth** - Replace localStorage auth with real authentication
2. **Enable Cloud Sync** - Activate Supabase for data persistence
3. **Add Error Recovery** - Implement proper error handling for network failures
4. **Test iOS Build** - Verify Capacitor build works on actual devices

### Recommended Testing Priority:
1. **Multi-device Testing** - Ensure responsive design works on all iPhone models
2. **Real Climbing Sessions** - Test 90-minute gap detection in real gym setting
3. **Data Recovery** - Test account recovery and data persistence
4. **Performance** - Monitor app performance with 100+ sessions
5. **Calculation Accuracy** - Verify all formulas with climbing coaches

The app demonstrates excellent attention to detail in UX design and climbing-specific features. The progressive disclosure of features based on calibration is particularly well-implemented. With minor adjustments for production authentication and data persistence, Pogo is ready to help climbers track their training journey.
